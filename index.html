                <h3>My greatest professional achievement was completing my Bachelor's degree in 4 years with a 3.8 GPA.
                    <br> I had no financial support from my family and had to work a full-time job while pursuing my
                    Economics degree.
                    <br> This taught me to prioritize my time,
                    build great habits and stay focused on my goals.
